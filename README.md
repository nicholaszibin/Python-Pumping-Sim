# Python-Pumping-Sim

This function simulates a variable speed pumping system to calculate flow and power as a function of rpm This is useful for estimating the flow of variable speed pumping systems when no flow meter is available.The function can also estimate rpm as a function of flow.

The required inputs to the function are the pump curve, system curve, and pump RPM range to be evaluated. The function outputs are polynomical curves relating:
- RPM to Flow
- RPM to Power
- Flow to RPM
