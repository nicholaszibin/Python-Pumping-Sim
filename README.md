# Python-Pumping-Sim

This function simulates a variable speed pumping system with a static lift 
head curve. First, you enter in the pump and system curve information. 
The function then calculates a curve relating rpm to flow and rpm to kW.
This is useful for estimating the flow of variable speed pumping systems
when no flow meter is available.
